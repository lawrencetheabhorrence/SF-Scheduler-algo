# SF-Scheduler
A Sportsfest timetable generator utilizing genetic algorithms. Implemented in Python.

# Running the tests
For running the tests, you will need to install [pytest](pytest.org). To install it with `pip`, run `pip install -U pytest` in your terminal.
You can run tests by going to any directory in the repository and typing `pytest` in the terminal once you have installed pytest.

# Writing tests
Test files must begin or end with `test_` or `_test.py`. However, it is preferred to begin your files with `test_`. Testing functions must also begin with `test` in their names.
